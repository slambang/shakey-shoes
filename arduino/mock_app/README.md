This is also a wrapper around [circular_buffer](https://github.com/slambang/shakey_shoes/tree/master/common/circular_buffer) adapting it for the desktop platform. This app is used to provide debugging capabilities for [circular_buffer](https://github.com/slambang/shakey_shoes/tree/master/common/circular_buffer) (which are not available on the ESP8266).
