This is a very small wrapper around [circular_buffer](https://github.com/slambang/shakey_shoes/tree/master/common/circular_buffer), adapting it for the Arduino platform. When items are received from the buffer, this app uses the values to instruct the vibrating motor to activate with different intensities.

- C/C++ using Arduino IDE
- Runs on the ESP8266
